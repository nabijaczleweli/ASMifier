ASMifier mod
========

This mod is (AFAICT) one of its kind - it makes it possible to program in Assembly inside Minecraft.

####Asembly info

The [NASM](http://www.nasm.us) [syntax](http://nasm.us/doc/nasmdoci.html) is used.<br />
The Assembly interpreter cannot execute data. Ex: `db 0EBh,3Ch,90h`.

####Missing features that should be in

1. Full FAT16 emulation
  * Native library
    * If anyone would like to build Linux/OSx shared libraries (gcc), It would be __AMAZING__.
  * Most of the code is ready/late-dev

####Contributing

Both [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) and Java are fine, yet most of the code will be [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).
