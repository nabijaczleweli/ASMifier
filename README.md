# ASMifier mod

This mod is (AFAICT) one of its kind - it makes it possible to program in Assembly inside Minecraft.

#### Asembly info

The [NASM](http://www.nasm.us) [syntax](http://nasm.us/doc/nasmdoci.html) is used.<br />
The Assembly interpreter cannot execute data. Ex: `db 0EBh,3Ch,90h`.

#### Missing features that should be in

1. Full FAT16 emulation
  * Native library

#### Contributing

Both [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) and Java are fine, yet most of the code will be [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).
